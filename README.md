# Accessibility (a11y) for developers

The Internet is a really awesome place. Everyone can find something interesting for them here — and people who share their passion. But what about people who cannot use computers the same way as us? Blind or visually impaired people, people with motion or cognitive problems — they all have to struggle every day with tasks that are super simple for people without any disabilities. And our responsibility as developers is to create a world accessible to everyone. Recently, I spent a lot of time learning and thinking about many different aspects connected with accessibility in web development. This project is a place to help programmers understand challenges connected with accessibility and easily improved their products to make them available for everyone.
