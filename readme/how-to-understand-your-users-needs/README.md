# How to understand your users needs

To be honest, some time ago I had a big problem with accessibility — theoretically, I knew basic stuff about it but was not using that at all. Cause it was just a waste of time, isn’t it? I read some articles about the topic but they did not convince me. Also, nobody around me did it, it was not included in my studies curriculum, etc… It’s why I want to propose to you some experiments that helped me realize why accessibility is not just a “nice to have” feature but one of the most important things to consider during programming. They were really eye-opening for me — believe they can help you too.

The experiments I encourage you to perform are:

* [Visiting the Invisible exhibition](invisible-exhibition.md)
* [Emulating the color vision deficiencies in your browser](emulating-color-vision-deficiencies.md)
* [Unplugging the computer mouse](unplug-a-computer-mouse.md)
