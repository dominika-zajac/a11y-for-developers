# Unplug a computer mouse

Can a discharged mouse have something to do with accessibility? Surprisingly, yes! Many users with motor disabilities or using screen readers have to rely on keyboard navigation. Is your webpage fully support that? Where is the focus when you dismiss/delete items? Or when you open/close modal? Can you easily use arrows to iterate over dropdown or slider? Can you access all actionable elements on the page? How many clicks do you need to access more nested content (can you skip to the main content)?

So many questions â€” and probably you can add some additional to that list. Test your page against them (paying close attention to your custom elements). Keyboard navigation is not as easy as you think!
