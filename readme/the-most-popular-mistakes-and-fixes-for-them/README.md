# The most popular mistakes and fixes for them

Let's talk about mistakes connected with accessibility. Can't hide - the list is definitely not exhausted but I was trying to include the most important ones. If you see something missing - create an MR with changes or ping me via Twitter ([@domizajac](https://twitter.com/domizajac)).



Topics included in my list:

* [Insufficient color contrast ratio](insufficient-color-contrast-ratio.md)
* [Missing alternative text](missing-alternative-text.md)
