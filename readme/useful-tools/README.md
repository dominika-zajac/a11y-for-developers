# Useful tools

People make mistakes - it's a well-known fact. Fortunately, we have more and more tools that can help developers detect problems with a11y and keep their products accessible for everyone. In this section, you can find some of them I personally recommend.

**Important! Only around 57% of problems with accessibility can be found by automated tools. Remember to perform manual tests and involve people with disabilities in them if possible.**



Tools described in the section:

* [Lighthouse audits](lighthouse-audits.md)
* [Web Insights for Web](accessibility-insights-for-web.md)
* [jest-axe unit tests](jest-axe-unit-tests.md)
* [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y.md)
